When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I can think of two important reasons to create a remote repository.  The first reason is to have a backup of projects that is kept off-site.  The second reason would be used for collaboration with other developers with respect to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   If you allow your remote repository to be updated by other trusted contributors you want to ensure that the changes you pull back into your local repository are changes that you wish to commit.  Manually pulling information gives the developer more control over his\her source code and the ability to pull only changes they wish to incorporate.
